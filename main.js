/* First off, this weird gray text is a comment. This is not viewable in your game and is only viewable to you! 
See the slash and star that is at the beginning and end of this text? Well, that's how you make a comment in javascript! */

'use strict'

/* This line (the one above) is what starts off your game/ website! */
/* Next, lets do a simple command! The "var" command! You know what a variable is in Algebra, right? Same thing! 
It goes like this:  */

var x = 5;

/* See? Easy enough, right? Oh yea, and you see that semicolon at the end? That is necessary for your program! 
This ends off what you typed so you can do the rest of the code! */

/* Now lets use that var in the "if" command! */

if (x > 6) {
  console.log("Yay! The mysterious X beats all!");
}

/* Woa, okay! That was confusing! To say that in english, it pretty much means "if the variable 'x' is greater than 6, write 
'Yay! The mysterious X beats all!". You have to put everything between brackets so that it only counts what's inside the brackets,
instead of the whole code!
What's console.log? Well, that basically logs what's inside the parenthesis (known as the "argument") to the console. If it's
inside of quotation marks (known as a "string"), that is writing that it will project on the screen!
